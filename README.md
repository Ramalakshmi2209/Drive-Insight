Developed a Driver Demand Prediction System to optimize booking efficiency for a transportation service, leveraging
machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
Analyzed three datasets, including driver ping data and historical records, to create a comprehensive understanding of
driver availability.
Engineered features like lag variables to capture temporal patterns, enhancing the accuracy of demand predictions.
Deployed the system using Streamlit, resulting in reduced waiting times, improved service efficiency, and enhanced user
satisfaction.
